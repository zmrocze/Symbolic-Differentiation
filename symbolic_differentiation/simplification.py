""" A simple expression differentiated yields huge expression that needs to be simplified e.g. D(x/x) = (1*x-x*1)/x^2
    
    Simplification is accomplished using many rules responsible for a single simplification.
    Rules are of type:  r :: (Term, dict) -> (Term, bool). They take a term, simplify it if they can 
    and return possibly modified term with boolean saying if any simplification was made.
    Second parameter is a dictionary with simplification rules - only one simplification rule really needs it so to most of them this paramater is added 
    artificially with add_unused_parameter decorator. 
    example rule:  zero_in_product(3*0*x^2, rules) = 0, True
    
    Simplification is run in a loop untill no more simplification can be made. (do_simplifications)
    One run of the loop applies rules recursively on terms, starting from the root, then children. (simplify_helper)
    Those functions record if a change was made.

    Before do_simplifications() is run, in the expression we change 
    subtraction to addition with the opposite expression and division to multiplication by inverse. (preprocess())
    In the end we change it back. (postprocess)
    
    This is packed into simplify() function that takes term and returns term simplified.
